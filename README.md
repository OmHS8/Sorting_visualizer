# Sorting_visualizer

Sorting visualizer for Bubble sort and Selection Sort implemented using graphics.h header in cpp.

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
<br>
<br>
Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that selects the smallest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted list.
<br>

Allows to understand the working of bubble sort and selection sort visually.
